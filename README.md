# PairedCycleGan
This is a try of implementation of the paper 'PairedCycleGAN: Asymmetric Style Transferfor Applying and Removing Makeup' with PyTorch. 
https://adoberesearch.ctlprojects.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CVPR2018_Paper3623_Chang.pdf

The code is based on the implementation of junyanz's pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix project https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix. 

I principally modified the parts of 'model' and 'datasets' and also deleted the unnecessary parts for this implementation.

The dataset and result of training will be uploaded later.

P.S: The code may not look like exactly the same as described in the paper but the core ideas are the same.
